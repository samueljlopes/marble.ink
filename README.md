Marbling ink on the web. 
This repo is a proof-of-concept into how public-accessbible formulas for marbling ink can be adapted to vector graphics, specifically the paper.js library. The paper used for this is accessible here: papers/MathematicalMarbling.pdf

This was originally going to be a web app, but I've decided to adapt it to React Native for ease of portability. I also think touch controls will lead to a better UX experience across the board, given the effort I've taken to get mouse controls feeling at least somewhat intuitive. 
So, aside from getting rid of the very bad UI, this repo will live as testament to those early forays.
